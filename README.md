# Modelling EV growth in the City of Toronto - <h1>

This project used StatsCan and Open-Data Toronto data to model and visualize the growth of EVs in the city of Toronto for the next 3 decades. 

Model input parameters included a distrubtion by 2016 electoral wards of:
* population
* income
* vehicle registration
* current EV population distribution

The City of Toronto released an updated [EV Strategy Staff Report](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2020/ie/bgrd/backgroundfile-141238.pdf) highlighting city wide EV plans and goals for the next three decades.
